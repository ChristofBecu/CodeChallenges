## DESCRIPTION:

Write a function that takes a positive integer n, sums all the cubed values from 1 to n (inclusive), and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

# Examples: (Input --> output)

``` 
2 --> 9 (sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8)
3 --> 36 (sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27)
```

## SOLUTION

1. Loop (x) from 1 to given number (n)
2. Add to the result the power of n ^ 3

# EXTRA

1. multiply the given number with the given number + 1
2. divide the result with 2
3. result to the power of 2
